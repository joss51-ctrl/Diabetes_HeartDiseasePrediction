Diabetes and Heart Disease Prediction is an application that allows users to predict the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease based on their health parameters. The application utilizes a trained models and provides an intuitive interface for users to get predictions easily.

# How It Works
1. Users enter their health parameters such as age, blood pressure, glucose level, etc.
2. The system processes the input data and applies the trained classification models.
3. The application displays the prediction results, indicating the risk of diabetes or heart disease.
